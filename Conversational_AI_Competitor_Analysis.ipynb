    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Businesses in competitive locations often need to monitor their market rivals closely to stay relevant and maximize customer engagement. Specifically, clothing stores in bustling areas face intense competition, making it essential to understand the local landscape of competitors, their footfall trends, and peak hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is designed to address this challenge by creating a conversational AI pipeline using LangGraph that allows users to query and generate a report on nearby clothing store competitors. The system integrates a language model with a search tool to provide real-time data on competitors, including store footfall and busiest times, giving actionable insights to enhance business strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intended Beneficiaries\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution benefits the following groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Business Owners and Managers**: Clothing store owners or managers in areas with high competition can use this report to identify key competitors, analyze peak customer hours, and adjust their own strategies to improve market position.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Marketing and Strategy Teams**: Marketing teams responsible for local engagement can leverage insights on footfall trends to optimize promotions during high-traffic periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Real Estate and Location Analysts**: Location-based data on competitor footfall and busy hours can assist analysts in recommending ideal store locations for future openings.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Investors and Market Analysts**: Investors considering opportunities in retail can use competitor analysis to assess market saturation, business potential, and potential risks."
